# recon-ai
AI-powered drone surveillance system for real-time object detection in aerial footage, aligned with modern reconnaissance and defense needs.

# 🛰️ recon-ai

**AI-Powered Drone Surveillance System**  
Detect vehicles and structures in aerial footage using YOLO-based object detection models. Built for modern reconnaissance and non-kinetic warfare scenarios.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

`recon-ai` is a lightweight, beginner-friendly Python application designed to simulate real-world drone-based surveillance. It leverages **pretrained YOLOv8 models** to detect objects like vehicles, buildings, and other potential assets in aerial or drone-captured images/videos.

### 🛡 Why This Matters
Modern warfare increasingly relies on **intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)**. This project demonstrates how AI can support:
- **Automated border monitoring**
- **Threat identification**
- **Real-time situational awareness**
